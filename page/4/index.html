  From his debut feature, &ldquo;Man Push Cart&rdquo;, Ramin Bahrani has proven himself to be an effective teller of stories infused with social awareness and a generous sense of morality. He has the ability to sincerely and accurately examine the micro worlds that exist at the fringes of the wider world.
&ldquo;99 Homes&rdquo; focuses on Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield), a labouring carpenter in Orlando facing eviction after his loan defaults. Nash unsuccessfully challenges the notice in court.

  </h1>

  <img src="/img/knightofcups-03-1.png">
  Terrence Malick&rsquo;s follow up to 2013&rsquo;s dazzling &ldquo;To The Wonder&rdquo; is another meditation on the human world and the relationships and bodies that inhabit it. It&rsquo;s an introspective work intensely engendering the world he interacts with.
Malick&rsquo;s stylistic choices in &ldquo;Knight of Cups&rdquo; will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with his work and will do little to endear those who have been alienated by it in the past. It acts as a continued mood piece from “To The Wonder”, only this time there is more to distract him.

  Anyone who sees &ldquo;American Sniper&rdquo; as token patriotism is either unfamiliar with Eastwood&rsquo;s other work—work that regularly challenges the role of masculinity and violence buried in the American psyche—or is incapable of reading the images Eastwood has put in front of them.
Eastwood is not interested in the politics of the Iraq occupation because Kyle wasn&rsquo;t. But he does damn its personal violence and the country that produced it.
The film is shot entirely from Kyle&rsquo;s perspective and the final act is pure Kyle fantasy.

  <img src="/img/inside-out.jpg">
  At its best, &ldquo;Inside Out&rdquo; is a reminder of how melancholy infects memories once we realise there will come a day when we can&rsquo;t produce any more.
It is also a sincere—apparently—attempt to encourage empathy.
Matt Zoller Seitz wrote that it attempts to normalise sadness:
 &ldquo;Inside Out&rdquo; stands in opposition to an entire culture that tells people that happiness is the highest, best and sometimes only permissible emotion, and that sadness is an obstacle to being happy, and that we should concentrate all of our emotional and cultural energy on trying to eradicate sadness so that everyone can be happy.

  </h1>

  <img src="/img/macbeth-2015-1.jpg">
  Justin Kurzel’s &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; opens with the funeral of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth’s child. It’s common for writers to add scenes to Shakespeare that help render their telling unique and develop strands of his work that have yet to be explored.
The decision to include this is a bold move and suggests a particular subtext to the interpretation that will follow. That it never is, through dialogue or performance, is emblematic of an interpretation lacking in direction and depth.

  &ldquo;Thunder Road&rdquo; was my introduction to Springsteen. I&rsquo;d heard his music plenty of times before, I knew &ldquo;Dancing in the Dark&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hungry Heart&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m On Fire&rdquo;, &ldquo;Born To Run&rdquo;, but &ldquo;Thunder Road&rdquo; was the first of his song that stuck.
The opening verse was so vivid and pained. It was the song that made me want something more. It made me fearful of time and death and wasted opportunities. Through the song, he makes promises to his lover, he even signs off with &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a town full of losers and I&rsquo;m pulling out of here to win.
