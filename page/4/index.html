  Rodney Ascher’s infamous “Room 237” explored the possible hidden meanings within Stanley Kubrick’s treatment of “The Shining”. While each theory examined in the film became crazier and crazier, there was at least a commitment to analyse the ideas via extended footage from the film. Although never pushing back against the testimony, its documentation of its subjects was worthy of a documentary.
With “The Nightmare”, Rodney Ascher interviews eight sufferers of sleep paralysis.

  From his debut feature, &ldquo;Man Push Cart&rdquo;, Ramin Bahrani has proven himself to be an effective teller of stories infused with social awareness and a generous sense of morality. He has the ability to sincerely and accurately examine the micro worlds that exist at the fringes of the wider world.
&ldquo;99 Homes&rdquo; focuses on Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield), a labouring carpenter in Orlando facing eviction after his loan defaults. Nash unsuccessfully challenges the notice in court.

  Terrence Malick&rsquo;s follow up to 2013&rsquo;s dazzling &ldquo;To The Wonder&rdquo; is another meditation on the human world and the relationships and bodies that inhabit it. It&rsquo;s an introspective work intensely engendering the world he interacts with.
Malick&rsquo;s stylistic choices in &ldquo;Knight of Cups&rdquo; will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with his work and will do little to endear those who have been alienated by it in the past. It acts as a continued mood piece from “To The Wonder”, only this time there is more to distract him.

  <img src="/img/american-sniper.jpg">
  Anyone who sees &ldquo;American Sniper&rdquo; as token patriotism is either unfamiliar with Eastwood&rsquo;s other work—work that regularly challenges the role of masculinity and violence buried in the American psyche—or is incapable of reading the images Eastwood has put in front of them.
Eastwood is not interested in the politics of the Iraq occupation because Kyle wasn&rsquo;t. But he does damn its personal violence and the country that produced it.
The film is shot entirely from Kyle&rsquo;s perspective and the final act is pure Kyle fantasy.

  <img src="/img/inside-out.jpg">
  At its best, &ldquo;Inside Out&rdquo; is a reminder of how melancholy infects memories once we realise there will come a day when we can&rsquo;t produce any more.
It is also a sincere—apparently—attempt to encourage empathy.
Matt Zoller Seitz wrote that it attempts to normalise sadness:
 &ldquo;Inside Out&rdquo; stands in opposition to an entire culture that tells people that happiness is the highest, best and sometimes only permissible emotion, and that sadness is an obstacle to being happy, and that we should concentrate all of our emotional and cultural energy on trying to eradicate sadness so that everyone can be happy.
