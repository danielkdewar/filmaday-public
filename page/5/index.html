  Justin Kurzel’s &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; opens with the funeral of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth’s child. It’s common for writers to add scenes to Shakespeare that help render their telling unique and develop strands of his work that have yet to be explored.
The decision to include this is a bold move and suggests a particular subtext to the interpretation that will follow. That it never is, through dialogue or performance, is emblematic of an interpretation lacking in direction and depth.

  &ldquo;Thunder Road&rdquo; was my introduction to Springsteen. I&rsquo;d heard his music plenty of times before, I knew &ldquo;Dancing in the Dark&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hungry Heart&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m On Fire&rdquo;, &ldquo;Born To Run&rdquo;, but &ldquo;Thunder Road&rdquo; was the first of his song that stuck.
The opening verse was so vivid and pained. It was the song that made me want something more. It made me fearful of time and death and wasted opportunities. Through the song, he makes promises to his lover, he even signs off with &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a town full of losers and I&rsquo;m pulling out of here to win.

  After the dire operatics of &ldquo;This Is The Warning&rdquo; and the buzzing electronica of &ldquo;The Catalyst Fire&rdquo;, Dead Letter Circus have released their third album, &ldquo;Aesthesis&rdquo;.
The greatness of a musician is more than the skill of performance—it&rsquo;s in the skill of creation and the self-challenge of emotional exploration. This is why artists in general occupy the place they do in society as the honesty involved with artistic creation, including the honesty of self-criticism, isn&rsquo;t for everyone.

  I recently saw &ldquo;Magic Mike XXL&rdquo; at the cinema with a girlfriend and I can honestly say I’ve never experienced anything like it. It’s not often I go to the cinema with a girlfriend and it’s certainly not often the entire theatre is full of women. I don’t remember seeing a single male. I could feel the anticipation in the air as I was taking my seat, my friend and I already giggling and fidgeting like school girls.

  I hadn&rsquo;t seen Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;War of the Worlds&rdquo; since the cinema in 2005. While the overall film isn&rsquo;t very strong, there&rsquo;s some beautiful visuals going on.
I really love this through-the-broken-glass motif, which for most of the movie is used to show Tom Cruise&rsquo; Ray as the focal point, not only of the shot but of his own being.
First time. Second time. Third time. Ray thinks beyond himself and sees what really matters.

  After watching &ldquo;Sense8&rdquo;, Netflix&rsquo; new series from Andy and Lana Wachowski, I was struck by its sincerity and its confidence in directing viewers around the world.
They show us snapshots from around the world of different cultures living. Many times doing nothing more than, just simply living in a moment. &ldquo;Sense8&rdquo; is all about these moments.
The character of Nomi (Jamie Clayton) is a deeply personal piece of writing but she is simply one of many characters who have lived double lives.
