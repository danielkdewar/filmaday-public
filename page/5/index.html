  After the dire operatics of &ldquo;This Is The Warning&rdquo; and the buzzing electronica of &ldquo;The Catalyst Fire&rdquo;, Dead Letter Circus have released their third album, &ldquo;Aesthesis&rdquo;.
The greatness of a musician is more than the skill of performance—it&rsquo;s in the skill of creation and the self-challenge of emotional exploration. This is why artists in general occupy the place they do in society as the honesty involved with artistic creation, including the honesty of self-criticism, isn&rsquo;t for everyone.

  I recently saw &ldquo;Magic Mike XXL&rdquo; at the cinema with a girlfriend and I can honestly say I’ve never experienced anything like it. It’s not often I go to the cinema with a girlfriend and it’s certainly not often the entire theatre is full of women. I don’t remember seeing a single male. I could feel the anticipation in the air as I was taking my seat, my friend and I already giggling and fidgeting like school girls.

  I hadn&rsquo;t seen Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;War of the Worlds&rdquo; since the cinema in 2005. While the overall film isn&rsquo;t very strong, there&rsquo;s some beautiful visuals going on.
I really love this through-the-broken-glass motif, which for most of the movie is used to show Tom Cruise&rsquo; Ray as the focal point, not only of the shot but of his own being.
First time. Second time. Third time. Ray thinks beyond himself and sees what really matters.

  After watching &ldquo;Sense8&rdquo;, Netflix&rsquo; new series from Andy and Lana Wachowski, I was struck by its sincerity and its confidence in directing viewers around the world.
They show us snapshots from around the world of different cultures living. Many times doing nothing more than, just simply living in a moment. &ldquo;Sense8&rdquo; is all about these moments.
The character of Nomi (Jamie Clayton) is a deeply personal piece of writing but she is simply one of many characters who have lived double lives.

  <img src="/img/Screen-Shot-2015-05-13-at-5-48-52-pm.png">
  &ldquo;John Wick&rdquo; is the most visually appealing action film I have ever seen.
Generally speaking, I don’t like action films. They don’t interest me in the slightest. The tired story lines and boring “at the edge of your seat” chase scenes that have been replicated poorly countless times over leave me yawning rather than gripping at anything. It just doesn’t do it for me. John Wick is different. John Wick is beautiful.

  &ldquo;E.T. The Extra Terrestrial&rdquo; is a film where all of its cinematic elements serve to deepen the screenplay&rsquo;s subtext. It is a confident and sincere piece of filmmaking that speaks universal languages.
It focuses on what I think are Spielberg&rsquo;s two favourite themes: the family &amp; understanding. It&rsquo;s interesting that his two films that explore these themes the most, this and &ldquo;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&rdquo;, are films based on alien encounters.
