  &ldquo;John Wick&rdquo; is the most visually appealing action film I have ever seen.
Generally speaking, I don’t like action films. They don’t interest me in the slightest. The tired story lines and boring “at the edge of your seat” chase scenes that have been replicated poorly countless times over leave me yawning rather than gripping at anything. It just doesn’t do it for me. John Wick is different. John Wick is beautiful.

  &ldquo;E.T. The Extra Terrestrial&rdquo; is a film where all of its cinematic elements serve to deepen the screenplay&rsquo;s subtext. It is a confident and sincere piece of filmmaking that speaks universal languages.
It focuses on what I think are Spielberg&rsquo;s two favourite themes: the family &amp; understanding. It&rsquo;s interesting that his two films that explore these themes the most, this and &ldquo;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&rdquo;, are films based on alien encounters.

  I was moved to re-watch &ldquo;Let The Right one In&rdquo; after reading Kyle Turner&rsquo;s great write up on its queer and transgender themes.
With this in mind, it&rsquo;s a fascinating film to explore, very tender, and sincere. The genderlessness of both lead characters is made very apparent (below), as is their acceptance of attraction of each other.
Lina Leandersson as Eli in &ldquo;Let The Right one In&rdquo;.
Kåre Hedebrant as Oskar in &ldquo;Let The Right one In&rdquo;.

  When I can&rsquo;t think of anything to watch I put on Sidney Lumet&rsquo;s &ldquo;12 Angry Men&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;ve seen it more times than I can count and it still keeps me interested. I&rsquo;ve seen it enough to start disliking some elements of Miller&rsquo;s writing:
 when it&rsquo;s finally 11-1 in favour of not guily, I don&rsquo;t like the way Juror Nine proclaims &ldquo;Eleven to one!&rdquo;, or when Juror Eight reminds Juror Three that he&rsquo;s alone.

  As we find ourselves in the middle of the decade, there&rsquo;s been plenty of articles on the cinematic legacy of this decade, it&rsquo;s early works and what this means for the remaining five years.
Film publications are getting in early, publishing &ldquo;Best Films of the Decade so far&rdquo; lists, which as you can guess, are arbitrary and kind of pointless.
What is interesting is analysing the results across the different publications, from the critical to the popular.

  Before I jump into my 2015 best of list I’d like to begin by apologising to our legions of readers (ie. Mum) for how late this post is. I can assure you there is a good reason behind my tardiness - I just couldn’t bring myself to write my list when there was tickets to see Birdman sitting in my pocket. Way back at the beginning of December ‘14 we had booked “advanced screening” tickets to see Birdman in the first week of January 2015.
