  I&rsquo;m an admirer of Steven Soderbergh&rsquo;s THE KNICK and I&rsquo;ve written about my appreciation of his blocking work and the show&rsquo;s dialogue before.
When the first season was finished, I knew I wanted to do something to explore the work as a whole. My initial thought was to drain the colour so it could serve as more of an artifact and to make the blocking and use of shadow the primary visual focus (and because, as Woody Allen&rsquo;s Val states in Hollywood Ending, New York is a black &amp; white city).

  I&rsquo;ve been following Steven Soderbergh&rsquo;s THE KNICK since Cinemax announced the show. Soderbergh has always been one of my favourite filmmakers. Even when the content isn&rsquo;t interesting, he does enough with his staging and colour hues to make it interesting.
I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of television&rsquo;s format or its story arcs. The open-ended nature of the writing doesn&rsquo;t interest me and that the final point of consumption is a small box usually means the director doesn&rsquo;t need to think about filling the image with anything interesting beyond the direct action of the scene.

  “Ida” ends with a violent shot. The camera is hand-held for the first time. It shakes with each of Ida&rsquo;s steps.
She walks down a long road back to the convent. The black road indifferent to the greyed countryside it snakes through. She&rsquo;s been here before but this time it&rsquo;s different.
Ida now sees that all things are relative, not absolute. So why does she return to the church?
She&rsquo;s coming back to fuck up the establishment.

  In no particular order.
Ida Pawel Pawlikowski&rsquo;s Ida is an intensely personal film made up of austere images and profound depth. Returning to his homeland, Pawlikowsky explores themes of guilt and identity, intrinsic to modern Poland, through Ida, a novitiate nun preparing to take her vows who finds out she is Jewish.
Composing his images with the actors in the lower-third of the frame, he uses the space above as weight on the characters.
