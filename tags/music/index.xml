      <description>&amp;ldquo;Thunder Road&amp;rdquo; was my introduction to Springsteen. I&amp;rsquo;d heard his music plenty of times before, I knew &amp;ldquo;Dancing in the Dark&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Hungry Heart&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m On Fire&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Born To Run&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;Thunder Road&amp;rdquo; was the first of his song that stuck.
The opening verse was so vivid and pained. It was the song that made me want something more. It made me fearful of time and death and wasted opportunities. Through the song, he makes promises to his lover, he even signs off with &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a town full of losers and I&amp;rsquo;m pulling out of here to win.</description>

      <description>After the dire operatics of &amp;ldquo;This Is The Warning&amp;rdquo; and the buzzing electronica of &amp;ldquo;The Catalyst Fire&amp;rdquo;, Dead Letter Circus have released their third album, &amp;ldquo;Aesthesis&amp;rdquo;.
The greatness of a musician is more than the skill of performance—it&amp;rsquo;s in the skill of creation and the self-challenge of emotional exploration. This is why artists in general occupy the place they do in society as the honesty involved with artistic creation, including the honesty of self-criticism, isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone.</description>
